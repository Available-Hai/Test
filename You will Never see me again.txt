A summer's day the order came
The enemy has taken our land. 
Death and blood are over them 
We will never bend.
They shall die by our hands 
And never come back again.

My brothers held swords in their hand
My father said they will never bend. 
But suddenly my mother said remember them
You will Never see them..... Never see them.... Again
